<!-- About the website: 

Here's the deal: this guy Ivan has a problem that is sympthomatic for the millennial and zoomer generation, where we to a greater extent invest meaning and identity in work.
Don't be mistaken: finding fulfillment and self-realization in your work life is fantastic! However when we also stock our esteem and confidence in the outcome of what we produce, we will ultimately burn out having no substitute activity. 
That's where hobbies come in. The healthy hobby is a distraction from what is monetary and dutiful. It involves active rest, in opposite to passive rest. When we find a hobby that suits us, we are able to blissfully let go off the anxieties produced by a late bill, a deteriorating relationship or an awkward run-in with an aquiantance.
Because it is easier to give advice in third person, Ivan might even represent your own need for a hobby. He is just a projection map, really.
Yada, yada. Let's get on with it.
